The below prompt shows when the binary files differ, no prompt when the binary files are the same. Diff compares the entire file for similarities.
wal37@tux5:~/cs571$ diff color.gz color2.gz 
Binary files color.gz and color2.gz differ

The following is printed when the ASCII files are different when compared with diff, no prompt when files are the same. ASCII diff compares two files line by line for similarities.
wal37@tux5:~/cs571$ diff color color2
